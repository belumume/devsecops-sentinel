# **Project Summary: DevSecOps Sentinel**

Version: 1.8
Date: 2025-06-25
Current Phase: Phase 2 - Real Scanner Implementation

## **üéâ Major Accomplishments**

*   **[2025-06-25]** **Codebase Refactored**: Standardized logging across all functions and centralized the `get_github_token` function into a shared utility layer structure, eliminating duplication and improving maintainability.
*   **[Previous]** **Core Workflow Complete & Verified**: The end-to-end pipeline from a live GitHub PR to a posted GitHub comment is fully functional and robust.
*   **[Previous]** **AI Reviewer is REAL**: The `AIReviewerFunction` successfully uses Amazon Bedrock to perform real code analysis.

## **üìä Current Architecture Status**

### **‚úÖ Working & Verified Components**

*   **End-to-End Pipeline**: The entire serverless workflow (`Webhook` -> `API Gateway` -> `Step Functions` -> `Aggregator` -> `GitHub Comment`) is production-grade.
*   **`AIReviewerFunction`**: Fully implemented with real AI analysis.
*   **`AggregatorFunction`**: Production-ready logic for consolidating findings and posting reports.
*   **Security & IaC**: Strong security posture with webhook validation and least-privilege IAM. All infrastructure is defined in `template.yaml`.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Scanners Requiring Real Implementation**

*   **`SecretScannerFunction`**: Currently uses regex patterns. **Needs to be rebuilt** to execute the `trufflehog` tool.
*   **`VulnerabilityScannerFunction`**: Currently uses a hardcoded dictionary. **Needs to be rebuilt** to execute `safety` and `npm audit`.

## **üéØ Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)**

Our path to hackathon victory is clear. We must replace the two simulated scanners with real tool integrations.

1.  **Implement Real Vulnerability Scanner**: Rewrite the `VulnerabilityScannerFunction` to execute real security tools (`safety`, `npm audit`) as subprocesses and parse their output.
2.  **Implement Real Secret Scanner**: Rewrite the `SecretScannerFunction` to clone the target repository and run `trufflehog`.
3.  **Create and Deploy Lambda Layers**: Package the necessary binaries (`git`, `trufflehog`, `safety`, `npm`) into a Lambda Layer and deploy it to AWS. This is a prerequisite for the real scanners to function.

## **üìà Project Health: VERY GOOD**

The project's foundation is exceptionally strong. The most complex part of the architecture‚Äîthe serverless event-driven pipeline‚Äîis complete and working flawlessly. The remaining tasks are well-defined and focus on integrating the specific security tools that will make this a truly powerful and innovative DevSecOps solution.
