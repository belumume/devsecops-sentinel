# We will need these libraries for the scanner.
# Packaging them for Lambda, especially trufflehog, might require a custom build or layer.

# Core dependencies
boto3>=1.26.0

# Secret scanning - Note: trufflehog is distributed as a binary, not a Python package
# For Lambda deployment, we'll need to:
# 1. Download the trufflehog binary from https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/releases
# 2. Include it in a Lambda layer with proper permissions
# The binary should be placed in /opt/bin/trufflehog in the layer

# Alternative Python-based secret scanners we could use:
# detect-secrets>=1.4.0  # Yelp's detect-secrets
# whispers>=2.1.0  # Another Python-based secret scanner

# For now, using GitPython for repository operations as a fallback
GitPython>=3.1.40
