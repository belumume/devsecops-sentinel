# **Project Summary: DevSecOps Sentinel**

Version: 1.9
Date: 2025-06-26
Current Phase: Phase 2 - Real Scanner Implementation & Debugging

## **üö® CRITICAL ALERT**

*   **[2025-06-26]** **Execution Blocked by GitHub Authentication Failure**: The entire analysis pipeline is currently **non-functional**. The `SecretScannerFunction` is failing with a `401 Client Error: Unauthorized` when attempting to download the repository from GitHub. This is a critical bug that prevents any of the scanners from accessing the code.

## **üìä Current Architecture Status**

### **‚úÖ Working & Verified Components**

*   **End-to-End Pipeline**: The entire serverless workflow (`Webhook` -> `API Gateway` -> `Step Functions` -> `Aggregator` -> `GitHub Comment`) is production-grade.
*   **`AIReviewerFunction`**: Fully implemented with real AI analysis.
*   **`AggregatorFunction`**: Production-ready logic for consolidating findings and posting reports.
*   **Security & IaC**: Strong security posture with webhook validation and least-privilege IAM. All infrastructure is defined in `template.yaml`.

### **‚ùå Blocked & Failing Components**

*   **`SecretScannerFunction`**: **CRITICAL FAILURE.** The function cannot authenticate with the GitHub API to download the source code, rendering it inoperable.
*   **`VulnerabilityScannerFunction`**: **BLOCKED.** While the code is written, it cannot be tested until the GitHub authentication issue is resolved, as it also requires access to the repository files.

## **üéØ Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)**

Our path to hackathon victory is currently blocked. We must resolve the authentication issue before any other work can continue.

1.  **FIX GITHUB AUTHENTICATION**: This is the **only priority**. We must diagnose why the GitHub token stored in AWS Secrets Manager is failing. This involves:
    *   Verifying the token stored in AWS Secrets Manager is the correct, active token.
    *   Ensuring the token has the necessary `repo` scope to read repository contents.
    *   Confirming the `get_github_token` utility function is correctly retrieving and using the token in the API requests.

## **üìà Project Health: CRITICAL**

The project's foundation is strong, but the core functionality is currently broken due to the authentication failure. The project is at a standstill until this bug is fixed. All development effort must be focused on this single issue.
