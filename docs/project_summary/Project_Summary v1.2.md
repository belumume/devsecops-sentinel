# **Project Summary: DevSecOps Sentinel**

Version: 1.2  
Date: 2025-06-12  
Current Phase: Phase 1 Complete. Preparing for Phase 2: Full Scanner Implementation.

## **Latest Updates**

* **\[2025-06-12\]** Successfully debugged and resolved webhook authorization issues. The architecture has been simplified by moving signature validation into the main WebhookHandlerFunction.  
* **\[2025-06-12\]** Implemented the SecretScannerFunction Proof-of-Concept.  
* **\[2025-06-12\]** **Milestone Achieved:** Successfully deployed and tested the end-to-end workflow. A live pull\_request event from a test GitHub repository now correctly triggers the API Gateway endpoint and starts the AnalysisStateMachine execution in Step Functions.  
* **\[2025-06-12\]** The state machine successfully invokes the SecretScannerFunction PoC via the parallel Map state. The execution currently fails at the AggregateResults step, as expected, because the final aggregator function is a placeholder.

## **Next Steps**

1. Begin **Phase 2** of the project plan.  
2. Implement the initial AggregatorFunction to replace the placeholder in template.yaml and handle the output from the scanners.  
3. Implement the remaining scanner functions: VulnerabilityScannerFunction and AIReviewerFunction.  
4. Implement the logic within the AggregatorFunction to post results back to the GitHub Pull Request.
