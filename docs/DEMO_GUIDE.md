# DevSecOps Sentinel Demo Guide

## Expected Behavior (After All Fixes)

### When Opening a New PR

1. **Create PR with Description** (Recommended for Demo)
   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   Adding test files to validate DevSecOps Sentinel
   
   ## Changes
   - Added vulnerable dependencies
   - Included hardcoded secrets
   ```
   Result: Only DevSecOps Sentinel comments appear

2. **Create PR without Description**
   - GitHub posts: "No description provided."
   - DevSecOps Sentinel posts progress comment immediately after

### Progress Indicator Flow

2. **Analysis Phase** (30-60 seconds)
   - Secret scanner runs
   - Vulnerability scanner runs
   - AI reviewer runs
   - All execute in parallel

3. **Results Posted** (After analysis)
   - Progress comment is UPDATED (not a new comment)
   - Shows complete analysis results
   - No duplicate comments
